# CORE Product Brief (Rolling 3-Month Focus)

Refresh this primer at the start of each 3-month planning cycle (or when strategy shifts materially) so both agents stay aligned on medium-term direction.

## Approach
- _Treat quarterly goals as experiments: ship small, exploratory releases to validate hypotheses before investing heavily._
- _Design features as pluggable modules that can be removed quickly if experiments fail or priorities shift._
- _Continuously inspect results and adjust direction using agile ceremonies (reviews, retros, backlog grooming)._

## Goal
- _Describe the primary outcome CORE must deliver over the next quarter (e.g., "CORE enables teams to …")._
- _Emphasize that quarterly initiatives are experimental and should remain pluggable/removable until validated._

## Core Concepts
- _List 3–5 foundational ideas, workflows, or constraints that define CORE regardless of the sprint._
- _Explain how each concept influences architecture, UX, or prioritization._

## Ideal Use Cases
- _Capture 2–3 representative scenarios or personas who benefit most from CORE._
- _Highlight pain points solved and success measures for each scenario._

## Quarterly Focus
- _Summarize the key themes, bets, or KPIs targeted in this 3-month period._
- _Describe how each bet will be released iteratively to validate direction before investing in full-scale implementation._
- _Note major guardrails or deprioritized areas to avoid scope creep._

## Recent Achievements
- _Record the most important outcomes delivered in the last cycle and their impact._
- _Reference links (demos, PRs, metrics) so future readers understand context quickly._
